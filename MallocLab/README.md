<b>CSAPP MallocLab code</b>

mm.c code contains the functions that implement functions for dynamic memory allocation. The task is the part of the Computer Architecture course, built around the CSAPP textbook.

The details of the implementation are described in the <i>mm.c</i> source code file. The solution is implemented with the usage of the segregated free lists technique. It shows quite nice performance (91/100).

<i>The functions have not been implemented yet</i>
